Reductio Lambda License, Version 1.0 (RLL-1.0)

Copyright (c) 2025 Ad4ndi

The Reductio Lambda License (RLL-1.0) is a public license designed to protect the quality, beauty, and purpose of free software. It promotes a vision of programming as a form of creative, ethical, and academic expression, rather than as a commodity. Software licensed under the RLL-1.0 must remain readable, meaningful, and non-commercial. It is based on the philosophy of anarcho-syndicalist openness and rejects the notion of intellectual property in favor of collective contribution.

What is Dead Code

Dead code is code that is considered useless, dangerous, or intentionally obfuscated, something that would make the open source environment dirty and unintelligible. Dead code is considered a violation of the RLL-1.0 license.

Terms and Conditions

1. Any derivative works or projects incorporating code licensed under RLL-1.0 must also be licensed under RLL-1.0. Sublicensing under any other terms is strictly prohibited.

2. Attribution is encouraged, but not required. The Reductio Lambda License treats attribution as secondary to the value of collective, purposeful creativity.

3. Code must not be intentionally obfuscated. Readability, clarity, and structural elegance are critical. Code that is intentionally cryptographic, unreadable, or lacking in aesthetic considerations is considered dead code and violates this license.

4. The software may not be used for military, commercial exploitation, advertising, law enforcement, or surveillance purposes. Permitted uses include academic, artistic, educational, research, and activist contexts only.

5. All source code changes must include a clear and structured "Change Log" (e.g., `CHANGES.md` file) that documents what was changed, where, and why. Unexplained changes or undocumented branches are considered dead code and violate this license.

6. All code must be written entirely by humans, without the assistance of AI or machine code. Any code generated by non-human systems is considered dead code and is invalid under this license.

7. Every RLL-1.0-licensed project must include a short manifesto (e.g., `MANIFEST.md` file) explaining the intended utility or artistic/academic value of the project. Projects that have no stated purpose are considered dead code.

8. RLL-1.0 projects must not contain or promote religious or political propaganda. This includes, but is not limited to, support for political parties, religious teachings, or ideological propaganda. The creative space must remain neutral, inclusive, and focused on contribution and learning.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED WITH THE STRICT WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, PERFORMANCE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS ARE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE.

Compatible

The RLL-1.0 license is NOT compatible with MIT, GPL, etc. Anything written under the RLL-1.0 license cannot be relicensed, and projects that were under a permissive license like MIT cannot be relicensed to RLL-1.0. This is done to ensure the functionality and purity of the software. However, programs whose core code is written under RLL-1.0 can use libraries under all flavors of other open source licenses.

Contacts and Identification

This license does not require individual authors to be credited, since the authorship is understood as collective. However, if you want to express gratitude to the authors of RLL-1.0, you can refer to the following:

The Reductio Lambda License (RLL-1.0) was developed by members of the Lambda Axiom Software Circle in 2025.
